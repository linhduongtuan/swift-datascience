 - This repository contains the code and data files required for the article: [A Comprehensive Guide to Learn Swift from Scratch for Data Science](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/10/comprehensive-guide-learn-swift-from-scratch-data-science/)
 - You can start [Swift in Colab Notebook here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/notebooks/blank_swift.ipynb)
 
# Project Structure

 - MNIST.swift : Code to load the MNIST data and convert it into batch of tensors
 - Swift_Data_Science_MNIST.ipynb : Notebook of the project, can be directly run in Colab
 - main_model.swift : Main file of the model
 - t10k-images-idx3-ubyte, t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte, train-images-idx3-ubyte, train-labels-idx1-ubyte : MNIST train and test files
